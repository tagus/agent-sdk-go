THINKING BLOCK #1
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Let me analyze this request and execute a plan for comprehensive
e-commerce market analysis.

I need to:
1. Analyze current e-commerce trends and growth patterns
2. Calculate market projections for Q1 2025
3. Identify opportunities/risks for expansion
4. Provide data-backed recommendations

I'll start with trend analysis tool to understand overall trends,
then use market data lookup for specific statistics...
